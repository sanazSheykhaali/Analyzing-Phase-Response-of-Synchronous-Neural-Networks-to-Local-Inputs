# Analyzing Phase Response of Synchronous Neural Networks to Local Inputs

One of the hot topics in neuroscience with no doubt is the transmission of information between the brain regions as well as their communication. In this study, we develop a new method based on a dynamical system that defines the causal relationship between the brain neurons. We simulate a balanced neural network with differential equations that describes the evolution of the membrane potential of neurons. 

# Balanced Neural Network 
In a balanced network, each neuron fires irregularly. If the network involved in an ongoing task, the network shows synchronous activity in a gamma rhythm range irrespective of the irregular activity of neurons. We change the frequency of gamma waves by changing network parameters. By extending the theory of phase response curve from a single neuron to a neural network, we study the impact of perturbation on the network. 

# Result
Knowing the phase response curve of a network, we show that it is possible to predict their phase-locking state and to determine the effective connectivity between networks. In the next part of the study, we show that a neuron with higher frequency in respect to other neurons will behave as a dynamical hub in the whole network. Therefore, if we put the desired signal, aimed to route in the network, on a dynamical hub, the whole network will roughly detect the signal. This result gives us a new controlling tool in transmitting the information in the neuronal networks.
