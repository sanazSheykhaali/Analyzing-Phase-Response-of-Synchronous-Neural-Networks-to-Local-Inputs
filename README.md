# Analyzing Phase Response of Synchronous Neural Networks to Local Inputs

One of the hot topics in neuroscience with no doubt is the transmission of information between the brain regions as well as their communication. In this study, we develop a new method based on a dynamical system that defines the causal relationship between the brain neurons. We simulate a balanced neural network with differential equations that describes the evolution of the membrane potential of neurons. 

# Phase Response Curve (PRC)
The complexity of the brain is due to its numerous dynamical elements and their interactions. The human brain has around 100 billion neurons each of which has about ten thousand synapses connected to other neurons. The interaction between neurons, which happens via synapses, causes population activity of neurons. When brain is processing the input signals (i.e., when neuron is in specific activity), those populations involved in the activity, show an oscillation, which is a consequence of the synchronous activity of neurons. Therefore, synchronization has a critical role in the brain and we conducted our investigation based on the synchronous networks. In this study, we simulated a balanced neural network with differential equations that describes the evolution of the membrane potential of neurons. In a balanced network, each neuron fires irregularly. If the network involved in an ongoing task, the network shows synchronous activity in a gamma rhythm range irrespective of the irregular activity of neurons. First, We aimed to study the response of the synchronous neural networks to local input by means of PRC. 


# Balanced Neural Network 
By extending the theory of phase response curve from a single neuron to a neural network, we studied the impact of perturbation on the network. Knowing the phase response curve of a network, we show that it is possible to predict their phase-locking state and to determine the effective connectivity between networks. In the next part of the study, we show that a neuron with higher frequency in respect to other neurons will behave as a dynamical hub in the whole network. Therefore, if we put the desired signal, aimed to route in the network, on a dynamical hub, the whole network will roughly detect the signal. 

# Result
The aforementioned result gives us a new controlling tool in transmitting the information in the neuronal networks.

# Plot
Here is the modeling of neuron, from single neuron to neural network by the Hodgkin-Huxley model and also calculating the PRC of each of them. We used Euler method to simulate a balanced neural network with differential equations that describes the evolution of membrane potential of neurons.
